# Master Plan
The purpose of this document is to write down in a single place all thing personal projects I want to work on, and all the `new` things I want to learn. The hope is that by writing this down, I will hold myswlf accountable to get something done!

## Things I want to Learn more about
- Kubernetes
- Swift
- Building "Data Products"
- Building/Designing a Personal Website

### Kubernetes - Personally Hosted Cluster
I believe K8s to be an exciting technology that allows new higher levels of abstraction. Freeing the developer to deliver more code, more reliably. My plan to learn more about this technolgy is to use it to run/host all my personal project. My hope is to force myself to think of things in Cloud-Native way. Reason being, it seems to be the way things are going. Durring this proccess I may get things wrong, but that ok, that's all in learning. For this reason I want to host a couple project on my own K8's cluster. The cluster will be running on 3 Mac Mini's initally. I want to deploy and manage this cluster with the hope of learn!

Here is a list of project I hope my personal K8's cluster will power
- Personal Website
- MLB (Major League Baseball) Stats Scrapper
- Siri Shortcuts Server
- SO MUCH MORE  

I know there are many other ways to do this, and that K8s is probably overkill. That's not the point. The point is to learn and grow my knowledge/skils.


Stay Tuned...More to come!
